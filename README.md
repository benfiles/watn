Where are they now? An opponent tracker for League of Legends

python where_are_they_now.py team-id api-key
does a cursory look at the opponents in your team's match history and prints
an awkward report.  Other files are there as an attempt to get this code
into better shape, but they mostly don't work or do anything yet.
