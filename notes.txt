Process for regular observations...
pull tracked teams from the database
for each tracked team,
    observe current status
    check if current status matches last status:
        update obs_time if so
        add new entry if not
        
    lookup the team's current match history
    for each opposing team in history,
        check if it is in the team list, add to list if not
    pull all opponents of the tracked team from the db
    for each opponent,
        observe current status
        check if current status matches last status:
            update obs_time if so
            add new entry if not

To do:
-- a way to add a tracked team to the database
-- write opponent to database
-- get least of opponents per tracked team

-- write function observe(team_id)
